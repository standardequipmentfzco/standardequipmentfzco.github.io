These devices are technical means used in the synthesis of insulating coatings, new polymers, dielectrics and semiconductors. For work in the field of microelectronics are often used:

- diffractometers;
- atomic absorption spectrometer;
- microwelding installations;
- centrifuges, etc.

These installations will make it possible to fully equip the laboratory at a manufacturing enterprise, at a research institute.
