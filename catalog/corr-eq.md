## Load devices

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/zj8r8IjE9JZHFu2GagyRN8j96gUjje-metaNWIwMTZhMTYwOTA0MjNjODY1YjEzNGMxMDZhNzM2ZDMuanBn-.jpg)

 Cormet offers a variety of load devices for stress corrosion cracking (SCC), sulfide stress cracking (SSCC), hydrogen cracking (HIC), fracture mechanics and fatigue testing.

The test ring is the simplest and most affordable load device. Cormet offers test rings with loads of 10-20 kN and 20-38 kN. The most common type of test piece is a round tensile test piece that is passed through the lids of the test cell. Holders for flat specimens are also available, and individual holders can be made upon customer's request. A load cell can be added to the test ring to control the test load during longer tests as well as creep.

Electromechanical devices are the main equipment in studies of stress corrosion cracking. This system is PC controlled and allows low strain rate (SSRT), constant load (CL) and low cycle fatigue (LFCF) tests. Loading devices can be built into the autoclave and used both at room and elevated temperatures, as well as in high-temperature gas environments. There are a number of models, among which the most popular are devices with a load of 10 kN, 25 kN and 50 kN. The versatility and flexibility of the software allows you to simulate load processes using special graphs that can be combined or combined into a series.

The maximum cyclic load of the Cormet electromechanical tool reaches a frequency of about 0.1 Hz, depending on the amplitude, mode and the specified load schedule. Servo-hydraulic tools are required when working at a higher frequency. This instrument can also be built into an autoclave.

The basis of the HIC instrument is a conventional glass container. It is possible to install additional accessories such as: gas flow meter, meters, water trap, fume hood, ventilation and gas neutralization devices. The HIC testing procedure is described in NACE TM0284-2011

FPB four-point bending studies are often performed in HIC rooms. Four point bending (FPB) studies are described in NACE TM0177-05 Method B, ASTM G 39-2011 and ISO 7539-2 (1989).

Dead load tools are used to evaluate critical stresses in a given environment using the value of (TTF) time to break. NACE TM0177-05 Method A and ASTM G 47 â€“ 98 (2004) Standards Describes options for conducting tests for continuous load. Cormet also offers (CL) devices with both manual (spring) and automatically controlled actuators.

## Autoclaves and test cells

 The autoclave is a test cell with the possibility of creating a test medium with high pressure and temperature. The autoclave can be used both separately (static) and together with a recirculation circuit (dynamic). Autoclaves, like recirculation circuits, can be made from a variety of materials. The most common material for manufacturing is stainless steel. More corrosion resistant materials such as Hastelloy (Alloy C 276) and Titanium are used where necessary. For low temperature testing, Teflon coating can be used in autoclaves.

The autoclave, as a rule, has a cylindrical shape, but can be made in any other form, depending on the requirements of the customer. A flow cell is a tube through which water flows. Electrochemical and corrosion sensors can be installed both in the lid and in the bottom of the autoclave.

Low pressure test cells offer a wide range of design options as they do not assume pressure. Hydrogen Cracking Cells (HIC Method) are typically large glass containers that are tested in accordance with NACE TM 0284-11 and TM0177-05 Method B.

Autoclaves can include many add-ons and accessories such as electrochemical instruments, electromechanical and servo-hydraulic testers, mixers, agitators and rotating electrodes.

Cormet also manufactures a variety of TLC (thin layer) instruments with constant purge and cooled finger samples. Optionally, the set includes a small funnel under the sample, where drops of water condense. This water can be taken from the autoclave for chemical or electrochemical analysis can be carried out online in the funnel itself.

Hydrogen penetration tests are carried out in accordance with ISO 17081:2004(E) using a two-cell autoclave with a steel plate in between. Corrosion reaction and hydrogen evolution starts in one of the cells. Next, hydrogen penetrates through a steel plate into another autoclave, where its content is measured using an electrochemical method. Cormet designed this system for high-pressure and high-temperature applications, in conjunction with a loading device that provides a load on a steel plate. This system makes it possible to study the effect of pressure, temperature, and voltage on the kinetics of hydrogen penetration.

## Recirculation circuit

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/s0h7VBjgPzKssck64aUKIR5mZcD85y-metaMmUyYTAyZGI5OThmMjg4YzFmYzM1YTJkMWI3YWUwZTAuanBn-.jpg)

The recirculation circuit is used in laboratories in order to create an analogue of the real working environment, for example, in power plants, pipelines, steam turbines, deep sea research, etc.

Outlines have the following benefits:

- the large volume of water passing through the circuit reduces the effects that corrosion products have on the chemical composition of the water.
- water is purified using ion exchangers, special filters and ultraviolet cells
- real-time monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration, hydrogen, pH and medium conductivity
- creation of an environment with specified characteristics, which allows obtaining reproducible and high-precision measurement results

The contour allows you to simulate the conditions of the working environment at power plants, providing water of a certain chemical composition. Particular attention is paid to the monitoring of incoming and outgoing water flows, as well as the removal of water pollutants. An important part of the operation of the circuit is to control the concentration of dissolved oxygen and maintain a low electrical conductivity of water for experiments related to supercritical aqueous media.

Loops are used in the oil and gas industry to provide a larger volume of liquid through which ensures the stability of the chemical composition over a long test period. The circuit provides the high temperature and partial pressure of the H2S and CO2 gases, as these gases dissolve in the water tank at low temperatures. The circuits are designed to withstand the corrosive effects of H2S and CO2 gases. The structural material for the contour is quite often alloy C-276 (Hastelloy).

Cormet also manufactures high pressure and subatmospheric steam circuits that are used to simulate various kinds of steam turbine situations.
