Our company specializes in the supply of vacuum processing equipment, which is used in the production of textiles, food, pharmacology, metallurgy and other industries. It is divided into control systems, pumps, various presses, air blowers and other units. With this equipment, you can automate many processes, thereby reducing staff costs. The greatest demand is for chamber-type units for creating vacuum packaging, which is used both in the banking sector and for medical products. At that time, thermoforming machines were more demanding for industrial enterprises.

**Types of vacuum technology and equipment**

- The pulp and paper industry uses super-efficient liquid ring pumps;
- Vacuum packaging machines are used for packaging finished products and manufacturing semi-finished products.
- Provision of processes at oil refineries is carried out by steam ejector systems.
- Vacuum pumps are used in the organization of steel processing units, filter systems and in the chemical industry.

**Benefits of buying vacuum equipment from our company**

- A wide range of models, with passed strict quality control
- Affordable price due to direct cooperation with manufacturers

- Light and sound signaling of violations in the operation of furnace systems with display.
- Long-term operation with minimal maintenance. Free access to all furnace systems.
- Computer control and automatic operation.

**Vacuum furnaces are equipped with:**

- Molybdenum "shelves" for placing parts in the furnace.
- Loading "tables" for laying (unloading) parts on (with) "shelf(s).

Angstrom Engineering Inc. (Canada) - manufactures vacuum sputter deposition, electron beam evaporation, ion-assisted deposition, resistive thermal evaporation and space emulation equipment.
Angstrom Engineering Inc. (Canada) is a rapidly growing and one of the fastest growing technology companies in Canada. The company, founded in 1992, is currently a global player in the vacuum process and research equipment market. Today the company offers equipment for various vacuum film deposition processes, such as magnetron deposition (sputter deposition), electron beam evaporation (electron beam evaporation), ion-assisted deposition, resistive thermal evaporation, as well as space emulation equipment.

**Emulation of outer space and environment**

Chambers equipped with high vacuum pumps and a temperature control system for testing components and assemblies in the vacuum of space.

Space simulation technology aims to create space conditions in the laboratory to test components that will eventually be sent into space. Pressure and temperature control are two key parameters required for space simulation. To achieve these conditions, Angstrom Engineering Inc. has developed a chamber in which it is possible to achieve the parameters of the vacuum of outer space using cryogenic and turbomolecular pumps in combination with mechanical foreline pumps. The temperature control system includes a combination of heaters and surface coolers. The temperature range depends on the heating and cooling method and usually ranges from -60ºC to 120ºC.

**Substrate Temperature Control Substrate  
temperature control**

Improvement of grain boundary migration, post-process annealing and control of surface reactions are a set of applications for the substrate temperature control function. For various heating or cooling applications, the company has several standard options. Customized solutions are also available for your substrates and temperature range.

**Biasing  
Bias**

If you're looking to control film density or improve adhesion, Bias can be the answer. Angstrom Engineering can configure your platform to include DC or RF bias. **Planetary**

**Motion**

Our planetary gear platform improves film uniformity on a wide variety of substrates. Normally pre-installed on our machines in the Åmod and EvoVac ranges, planetary gears can greatly increase system performance.

**Substrate Cleaning Substrate Cleaning

Ion

**Assisted Deposition**

In IAD (ion sputtering), a broad ion beam source directs a scattered ion beam of ions of various energies directly onto the substrate, usually in conjunction with a magnetron sputtering source or an electron beam sputtering source. An inert gas such as Ar or reactive gases such as O2 and N2 can be used to provide additional chemical reactions during film growth. IAD processes improve film growth processes through surface reactions, control film density and improve film adhesion. Angstrom Engineering can enhance your system by adding an ion source for your processes. Angstrom Engineering's software solutions allow precise, thorough control of processes in systems.

**Electron Beam  
Evaporation**

In electron-beam evaporation, the cathode emits a high-energy electron beam focused by a magnetic field, which, falling on the material in the crucible, carries away the deposited material from the crucible, which is deposited on the substrate. Powerful evaporators and well-designed evaporator sets enable high film growth rates and high film thicknesses. Also, this design allows you to increase the number of processes and deposition time until the chamber is de-vacuumed to replenish the evaporated material in the source.
The deposition of refractory materials can reach high speeds, which can be effectively used to increase the heat resistance of metal and ceramic films. The volatilized deposited material may maintain a surface layer of unmelted material protecting the crucible from corrosion or contamination.
Angstrom Engineering installs electron beam evaporators into systems and provides advanced spray control and management for the most demanding applications. Systems can be configured using both standard platforms (systems) and custom-made to fully meet customer requirements.
