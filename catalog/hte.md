## Vacuum furnaces for heat treatment

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rwnFxKyP0ndBpdG6UtoHq4gjJKo6r8-metaNzlkZjk1OWI0YzA0Mzg0NDcyMjk2MDgzNGM0ZTk1OTMucG5n-.png)

Vacuum furnaces are used for annealing and aging of products made of various materials, such as tungsten, molybdenum, niobium, copper alloys, etc., as well as electrical steel, permanent magnet alloys, stainless steel, high temperature alloys, hydrogen storage alloys, reactive metals and metals with high melting points. Structurally, furnaces can be with horizontal or vertical loading.

**Characteristics :**
 
- Maximum temperature in the working chamber, °C 	 750-1300
- Ultimate vacuum Pa 	 2×10 -3   
- Maximum overpressure, bar 	 2
- Temperature uniformity, °C          	 ±5       
- Leakage rate (in a cold empty vacuum furnace), Pa/h       	 five        
- Working area, horizontal version (W×H×D), mm 	 from 400 × 400 × 600                 
- to 1000 × 1000 × 2000          
- Working area, vertical version (Ø×H), mm 	 from 400 × 400 to 2000 × 2000 

**Description:**

The furnaces can also be used for vacuum sintering of magnetic materials, diamonds, dehydrogenation of titanium alloys and steels. The furnaces are controlled by a programmable logic controller. The temperature in the furnaces is maintained with high accuracy by a separate controller. Furnaces have a high level of automation. During operation, the operator can safely switch from automatic to manual control mode, the furnaces have an emergency warning system. The furnaces are easy to set up, manage and maintain.

When designing this series of ovens, our designers paid special attention to ease of maintenance, reduced energy consumption, environmental protection and increased productivity.

**Design features and equipment:** 

- Water cooling of the furnace body and door, current leads and cooling gas circulation pipes. Gas cooling system with powerful fan and water heat exchanger.
- Heating chamber of square or round section.
- Thermal insulation and heaters made of graphite, molybdenum or tungsten.
- Autoclave type oven door with pneumatic blocking.
- Sealed connector for connecting up to 12 thermocouples in the furnace.
- A large set of additional components at the discretion of the customer.
- Light and sound signaling of violations in the operation of furnace systems with display.
- Vacuum pumps - Edwards, England or Laybold, Germany,
- Vacuum - Edwards, England or Laybold, Germany. Included in the State Register of Measuring Instruments of the Russian Federation.
- Controller - Siemens, Germany.
- Temperature control - thermocouples made in Russia, Included in the State Register of Measuring Instruments of the Russian Federation
- "Bookcase" for placing parts in a furnace made of molybdenum or heat-resistant alloy.
- Loading "table" for laying (unloading) parts on (s) "shelf(s).
- Transport trolley for loading (unloading) the "shelf" with parts into the oven (from the oven).

**Note:**

Characteristics are indicated for standard models, we offer furnaces with non-standard dimensions, an increased working area according to the technical specifications of the customer.

Vacuum furnaces with gas hardening are used for hardening of high speed steel tools, controlled hardening of tool and other alloy steels.

**Characteristics:**
  
- Maximum temperature in the working chamber, °C 	 1300 
- Temperature uniformity, °C 	  ±5
- Leakage rate (in a cold empty vacuum furnace), Pa/h 	  2×10 -3
- Ultimate vacuum Pa 	  0.001
- Maximum overpressure, bar 	  6/10/12/16/20
- Working area, (WxHxD), mm 	  from 200x200x400 to 900x900x1500
- Mass of the loaded cage at the same time, kg 	      from 30 to 1200


**Description:**

The furnaces have a convection heating function, which can be realized not only as stepwise isothermal quenching, but also quenching, annealing, carburizing, nitriding and other heat treatment processes.

The furnaces are controlled by a programmable logic controller. The temperature in the furnaces is maintained with high accuracy by a separate controller. Furnaces have a high level of automation. During operation, the operator can safely switch from automatic to manual control mode, the furnaces are provided with an emergency warning system.
