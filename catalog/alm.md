An innovative development for the production of components from several materials printed on a 3D printer.

The latest breakthrough, CeraFab Multi 2M30, brings the idea of ​​3D printing complex geometries from multiple materials. With this 3D printer, it is possible to combine not only ceramics, but also metals and polymers, which contributes to the gradual change in the composition and organization of materials within a component. The open system allows you to develop your own materials, and now you can produce multifunctional components that are not possible with conventional molding technologies. Designers can integrate additional processes (eg inkjet printing, coating) to extend the CeraFab Multi 2M30's range of capabilities for even more complex applications.

## HEAVY DUTY OPTIMA

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Yx6fehsj8riFDSqAynktgX6sGlgkMq-metac2thbmVyeTMuanBn-.jpg)

- Blue LED projector
- Accuracy certified according to VDI / VDE recommendations
- Two 5 megapixel cameras
- Low power consumption (20W)
- The Heavy Duty Optima is ideal for companies where high measurement accuracy is a key factor for the customer and they want to maintain this performance despite the small budget available.
- Applications: reverse engineering, quality control and rapid prototyping

**eviXscan 3D Heavy Duty Optima** is a professional reverse engineering tool for 3D scanning, non-contact quality control and rapid prototyping of medium sized models.

Optima is an optimized combination of key parameters for the customer: high precision measurement (up to 0.0183 mm), high dot density (95 pt/mm²) and large scan volume (250 mm x 170 mm x 120 mm), all at an affordable purchase level and implementation of an integrated measuring system.

The Heavy Duty Optima is ideal for companies where high measurement accuracy is a key factor for the customer and they want to maintain this performance despite the small budget available.
The Heavy Duty Optima is equipped with two high-quality 5MP cameras and a powerful blue LED light source, keeping power consumption low (20W) and reducing heat dissipation while extending product life. The advantage of a specific wavelength of the light source helps to limit the influence of the optics on the collected data, with blue light having the lowest diffraction, helping to keep measurements at the highest level.

**APPLICATION EXAMPLES**

- measurement of hard-to-reach objects
- creating all kinds of 3D renderings
- reverse engineering of elements without CAD documentation
- measurements of deformed / welded elements and comparison with the CAD model
- quality control of manufactured parts
