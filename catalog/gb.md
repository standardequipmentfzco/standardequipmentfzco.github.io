The glove box is a device designed to protect the operator from the influence of hazardous substances with which it will be necessary to perform certain technological processes or experimental steps of the technological process, as well as to protect the material with which the work is performed from the unwanted effects of atmospheric air (for example, oxygen or water vapor ).

When a glove box is used to protect a substance from the influence of atmospheric air, then in general, the glove box must be filled with high-frequency gas or nitrogen with a slight overpressure. It is necessary to take into account certain requirements for the protective atmosphere provided by the glove box. When the requirements are higher, the content of oxygen or water vapor is allowed at the level of 1 ppm, in this situation it is advisable to consider glove boxes with a built-in circulating gas cleaning system.
