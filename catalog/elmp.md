 For decades, marking equipment from the American brand Telesis has been at the forefront of engineering. The company was one of the first to develop its own fiber laser markers for processing products made of metal and other materials (wood, glass, plastic, etc.).

The recognition of Telesis metal laser markers as one of the best on the market is explained by the high requirements of the company's engineers to the quality of their equipment. Laser markers are manufactured using the most advanced technologies and tested in laboratory conditions.
