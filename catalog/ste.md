## Cisco UCS X9508 Chassis Data Sheet

The Cisco UCS® X-Series Modular System simplifies your data center, adapting to the unpredictable needs of modern applications while also providing for traditional scale-out and enterprise workloads. It reduces the number of server types to maintain, helping to improve operational efficiency and agility as it helps reduce complexity. Powered by the Cisco Intersight™ cloud-operations platform, it shifts users’ IT focus from administrative details to business outcomes—with a hybrid-cloud infrastructure that is assembled from the cloud, shaped to their workloads, and continuously optimized.

The Cisco UCS X-Series Modular System begins with the Cisco UCS X9508 Chassis engineered to be adaptable and future ready. It is a standard, open system designed to deploy and automate faster in concert with a hybrid cloud environment.

With a midplane-free design, I/O connectivity for the X9508 chassis is accomplished with frontloading, vertically oriented compute nodes intersecting with horizontally oriented I/O connectivity modules in the rear of the chassis. A unified Ethernet fabric is supplied with the Cisco UCS 9108 Intelligent Fabric Modules. In the future, Cisco UCS X-Fabric Technology interconnects will supply other industry-standard protocols as standards emerge. Interconnections can be easily updated with new modules.

7-Rack-Unit (7RU) chassis has 8x front-facing flexible slots. These can house a combination of compute nodes and a pool of future I/O resources that may include GPU accelerators, disk storage, and nonvolatile memory.
2x Cisco UCS 9108 Intelligent Fabric Modules (IFMs) at the top of the chassis that connect the chassis to upstream Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects. Each IFM features
Up to 100 Gbps of unified fabric connectivity per compute node
8x 25-Gbps SFP28 uplink ports. The unified fabric carries management traffic to the Cisco Intersight cloud-operations platform, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) traffic, and production Ethernet traffic to the fabric interconnects.
At the bottom are slots ready to house future I/O modules that can flexibly connect the compute modules with I/O devices. We call this connectivity Cisco UCS X-Fabric technology because “X” is a variable that can evolve with new technology developments.
Power Supply Units (PSUs) provide 54V power to the chassis with N, N+1, and N+N redundancy. A higher voltage allows efficient power delivery with less copper and reduced power loss.
dual counter-rotating fans deliver industry-leading airflow and power efficiency. Optimized thermal algorithms enable different cooling modes to best support the network environment. Cooling is modular so that future enhancements can potentially handle open- or closed-loop liquid cooling to support even higher-power processors.
