## Optical emission spectrometer OBLF QSN 750-II

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/GHAUrEXUfYJJgq4UtJ4ZvcnKA2PEPT-metaNzlhM2I2MTkwYmY5Y2VhNTRkMDM3NDZiNGQzNDFiNDEuanBn-.jpg)

The OBLF QSN 750-II instrument is a spark vacuum optical emission spectrometer with an optical system radius of 750 mm, which can be used as a **single or multi-matrix**. As a result, the spectrometer has a wide field of applications not only in the production of metal in industrial production, but also in testing materials in research institutes.

The integrating electronics and photomultipliers, selected according to customer specifications, are placed in an optical chamber, and thus protected from external influences. Thermally stabilized optics and a **GDS digital pulse generator** guarantee a high degree of signal reproducibility and analytical consistency. The design of the easily dismantled self-cleaning patented **spark rack** and optical chamber entrance window allows the user to maintain them without difficulty. Used argon is cleaned by a filter.

Unlike the "little brother" GS 1000-II , the QSN 750 optical emission spectrometer can also be used in an automated system. In this case, the device, working together with the sample preparation device and the robot arm, is equipped with an automatic system for cleaning the counter electrode. The results of the analyzes are transmitted to a subordinate computer system via a network connection. To ensure optimum quality control, the spectrometer measures control samples fed by the robot at regular intervals. The key to functioning is to constantly monitor and, if necessary, transfer this information to other systems.

When using multimatrix systems for a huge number of analytical problems, a large number of analytical programs may arise. For such complex systems , **the spectrometer software** , called OBLFwin, provides numbered stand-alone programs that fully meet the needs of the customer. In addition, there is an automatic program selection that makes it easy to assign the correct analysis program. Depending on the application - which material is being detected - the measured values ​​appear on the screen approximately 16-30 seconds after the start of the measurement process and can be printed, transmitted over the network or processed later.

## Optical emission spectrometer OBLF QSG 750-II

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/KbQBpL5HesfzeQQfLItMIOJwujxbW4-metaYmRiY2Y1NjhjOWRmZGVjOTZmMjViZWYzM2M5Y2EyMjMucG5n-.png)

The optical emission spectrometer QSG 750 of the West German company OBLF Spectrometry GmbH can rightly be called a flagship model. This **single or multi-matrix model** is ideal for all applications requiring the lowest possible limits of detection, maximum reproducibility, and additional metallurgical information about the analyte. The range of applications ranges from the main industries of steel or rolling mills and metalworking industries up to research institutes and universities.

At first glance, the QSG 750-II is comparable to the **QSN 750-II** . Both models have original identical dimensions, hardware components that have proven their practical reliability: a temperature-stabilized 750 mm **vacuum optical chamber** , a strobe-pulse generator with a time-selected current selection (GDS technology) with freely variable parameters, a self-cleaning **spark stand** . Used argon is cleaned by a filter. Easily dismantled design simplifies the necessary service performed by the user.

The main difference from other OBLF instruments lies in the data recording system based on the GISS technology developed by OBLF (Gated Integration of Single Sparks - Gated Integration of Single Sparks). The GISS recording technology, combined with real-time processing of the single spark intensities of all measurement channels, together with time-resolved spectroscopy, makes numerous additional applications possible. Single spark spectrometry (or PDA - pulse distributed analysis - pulse distribution analysis) provides the necessary information about the microscopic composition of the sample, the homogeneity of the sample, the amount of dissolved and undissolved component (for example, aluminum in steel), and also allows you to detect and determine inclusions. To provide these opportunitiesThe OBLFwin **spectrometer software contains additional features for identifying bad samples or inclusions**. All single spark data can be exported to another computer. Time-resolved spectroscopy can reduce spectral interference and significantly improve detection limits for a number of elements compared to standard spectrometers. It opens up new possibilities in the analysis of pure metals.

All QSG 750 multifunction instruments can be operated manually or automatically for a wide range of applications, especially in the steel industry. In the automatic case, the sample is placed by a robot, and the counter electrode is cleaned by a device specially adapted to the spark stand. The measured values ​​are automatically transferred to the slave systems using a network connection. An integrated modular software system manages and monitors the performance of the spectrometer. The job responsibilities of the system also include the management of analyzed and recalibrated samples.
