COJAFEX (Netherlands) is the world's leading manufacturer of induction pipe bending equipment. For more than thirty years of history, the company has won more than 70% of the world market in this area and, almost exclusively, the markets of Europe and the USA.

The technology offered by COJAFEX allows bending pipes of various radii, including 1 D in a wide range of sizes.

Bending is carried out with minimal wall thinning in combination with a small ovality. The technology is mainly suitable for relatively large pipe diameters, which is applicable in the fields of thermal and nuclear energy, the production of pipelines for pumping stations, the chemical and petrochemical industries. The workflow allows you to work in a wide range of materials - from carbon steel to stainless steel and alloys with special properties. All models are computer controlled.

Main advantages:

- Variable bending radius. The proposed technology makes it possible to perform bending with various radii within one pipe, including 1 D radii, using only one set of equipment for one pipe diameter. The bending radius can be any (within the limits of installation possibilities).
- Bending can be performed while maintaining straight sections of any length, both before the first bend and after the last bend, and between bends. This reduces the number of welds in the system and avoids welding at critical points (tangential), which cannot be avoided with elbows.
- The installation allows you to perform several bends within the same pipe, including in different planes and with minimal radii, which reduces the number of required welds.
- High bend quality, low wall thinning and ovality compared to cold bending.
- The minimum required set of tools (no separate bending sector is required for each radius, as with cold bending).
- The CNC system based on an industrial computer in combination with an electromechanical servo drive allows you to obtain excellent quality at the beginning of the bend, throughout the bend and at the end of the bend thanks to a special algorithm for coordinated movements of the inductor and pipe.
- The positioning accuracy of the bending angle and the angle of rotation of the pipe is 0.1Â°, the accuracy of the longitudinal feed of the pipe is 0.1mm.
- Continuous measurement of the temperature of the heated metal both along the outer and inner contours of the bend with automatic control of the generator power level and saving temperature charts on the hard drive of the computer with the ability to print a report on the printer for each bend allows for constant quality control.
- The restart function allows you to continue bending from the same place where it stopped for some reason and bend the bend.
