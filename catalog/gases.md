## Hydrogen generators

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Sirio-Hydrogen-Generator.jpg)

 The new Sirio on-site hydrogen generator, by virtue of the very high levels of purity guaranteed by ErreDue’s PEM (proton exchange membrane) technology, perfectly meets the needs of all those applications where a moderate amount of pure, compressed gas is needed, such as heat treatment of metals and Biomethane production processes.

Sirio is Plug & Play: thanks to its ease of use and autonomy, it only needs to be connected to an electrical power source and the tank filled with water to be able to produce pure hydrogen immediately at the pressio- n and flow rate required. In fact, it does not require any auxiliary systems: the unit includes a generator, water tank and purification system for the gas produced.

Hydrogen flow rate starts from 0.5 m3/h up to 2 m3/h, it is also possible to connect multiple systems in paral- lelo. The maximum pressure generated reaches up to 15 bar in catalog models and can be customized up to 30 bar on request.

ErreDue Sirio hydrogen generators can be monitored and managed remotely with ErreDue’s built-in connectivity and remote service.

## Hydrogen and Oxygen generators

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Generatore-di-idrogeno-Mercury.jpg)

Mercury alkaline hydrogen and oxygen generators are a perfect solution for any industrial need.

Thanks to ErreDue’s innovative electrolytic technology, Mercury generators produce hydrogen and oxygen perfectly separated from each other, directly at the required pressure (5, 12 or 30 bar).

In case of applications where a very high gas purity (up to 99.9995%) is required, ErreDue can offer a wide range of purifiers, even integrated in the generator, in order to meet every need.

Mercury generators can be powered by renewable sources to provide a clean energy storage solution, including in conjunction with fuel cells.

ErreDue can also provide customized solutions such as complete container systems up to 1 MW, hydrogen car charging stations, and many others.

ErreDue hydrogen and oxygen generators can be monitored and managed remotely with ErreDue’s remote service.

All ErreDue gas generators are available for rental and sale in the Italian territory

## Nitrogen generator

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Generatore_di_azoto_puro.jpg)

Saturn’s ultra-pure nitrogen generators produce a continuous flow of nitrogen free of oxygen and residual moisture (purity up to 99.9999%) by filtration and subsequent purification of a stream of compressed air.

The very high purity of nitrogen produced by Saturn generators is made possible by the addition of a small percentage of hydrogen (0.5-1%) that is produced directly by the system and added to the gas stream. Subsequent passes through a reactor and molecular sieve ensure that oxygen and other gases and traces of moisture are removed.

Saturn generators have fully automatic operation, controlled by a PLC with a touchscreen interface. Like all ErreDue products, Saturn generators can be controlled remotely via Ethernet connection.

Saturn generators make it possible to eliminate the use of liquid nitrogen cylinders and containers, saving considerable resources for ‘company and maintaining a very small footprint.

The production capacity of Saturn generators can be increased even after installation by simply adding modules.

## Venus nitrogen generators

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/generatori-venus.jpg)

Venus ErreDue nitrogen generators produce a continuous flow of pure nitrogen using PSA technology, which consists of filtering simple compressed air.

The Venus system is modular and consists of pairs of columns filled with filter material, which retains oxygen and other gases while allowing only nitrogen to pass through, directly at the required purity and pressure. The special feature of this system is the automatic regeneration of the columns, so that scheduled maintenance work is minimized.

A PLC control system, combined with software developed by ErreDue, automatically manages the process of gas production and regeneration of exhausted columns by reverse gas flow.

Venus generators produce nitrogen with purity up to 99.9995% and with flows up to hundreds of cubic meters per hour.

All ErreDue gas generators are available for rental and sale in the Italian territory.

## Gas purifiers

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Depuratore-di-gas.jpg)

ErreDue designs and manufactures a wide range of machines intended for the purification of gas, whether produced by generator or otherwise.

Purification allows for safe quality gas at all times, guaranteed by continuous PLC process control.

Gas purification also makes it possible to recover and reuse very expensive process gases that are normally dispersed into the atmosphere, resulting in great savings and rapid depreciation of the machine.

The following gases can be purified and reused with these machines:

HYDROGEN – ARGON – OXYGEN – NITROGEN – METHANE, etc.
As with generators, remote assistance via modem is also provided for purifiers, with ON-LINE intervention possible.
